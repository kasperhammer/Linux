# StartUpService.c Documentation
## Purpose
The purpose of the StartUpService.c file is to implement a program that starts up during system boot and runs in the background as a daemon. The program sets up and manages threads to collect and update time and temperature information, which is then displayed on a screen. Additionally, the temperature information is published to an MQTT broker.

## Functions
1. `int BitPrint(int bits)`
   This function prints a binary representation of an integer to the console. It is used for debugging or diagnostics.

2. `void InterpolateAndPrint()`
   This function combines temperature and time information and displays the combined string on a screen. It continuously updates the screen with the latest information.

3. `void *getTime(void *arg)`
   This thread function continuously retrieves the current time and updates a global variable with the time information. Then, it calls `InterpolateAndPrint()` to update the screen.

4. `void *getTemp(void *arg)`
   This thread function continuously retrieves the current temperature and updates a global variable with the temperature information. Then, it calls `InterpolateAndPrint()` to update the screen.

5. `void *publishTemp(void *arg)`
   This thread function continuously publishes the temperature information to an MQTT broker.

6. `int main(void)`
   This function is the entry point of the program. It initializes the system, creates threads for time, temperature, and MQTT publishing, and then exits the program.

## Daemon Implementation
To run StartUpService.c as a daemon during system boot, follow these steps:

Compile the code: Compile your StartUpService.c file into an executable file. For example, you can use the GCC command:
   ```bash
   gcc StartUpService.c -o StartUpService -lpthread
   ```
   Copy the executable file to the bin directory: Copy the compiled executable file (StartUpService) to /usr/local/bin or another appropriate location.
   ```bash
   sudo cp StartUpService /usr/local/bin
   ```
   Create a systemd service file: Create a systemd service file (e.g., startup.service) in the /etc/systemd/system/ directory with the following content:
   ```plaintext
   [Unit]
   Description=Startup Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/StartUpService

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
   Reload systemd daemons: Reload systemd daemons to update the service configurations.
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
   Enable and start the service: Enable and start the new service.
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable startup.service
   sudo systemctl start startup.service
   ```

Now, StartUpService will run as a daemon during system boot and continue to run in the background, collecting time and temperature information, updating the screen, and publishing temperature information to the MQTT broker.

## Notes
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run StartUpService as a daemon, and all dependencies are met.
You can adjust the service configuration as needed, such as specifying a different executable path or adding additional startup parameters.

# IpGet.c Documentation
## Purpose
The purpose of the IpGet.c file is to contain functions for retrieving the local IP address from the system. This is useful when connecting to a local network device or when needing to know the local IP address for other purposes.

## Functions
1. `char *GetLocalIp()`
   This function returns a string representing the local IP address of the system. The function creates a socket, retrieves the IP address from the desired network interface, and then formats the IP address as a string.

## Implementation
To use IpGet.c in your project, follow these steps:

Include the header file: Add the following line at the top of your source file to include IpGet.h:
   ```c
   #include "IpGet.h"
   ```
   Call the function: Use the `GetLocalIp()` function in your code where you need to retrieve the local IP address. Example:
   ```c
   char *ipAddress = GetLocalIp();
   printf("Local IP Address: %s\n", ipAddress);
   free(ipAddress); // Remember to free the memory after use
   ```
   Compile the source files: When compiling your project, make sure IpGet.c is included in the command.

## Notes
The `GetLocalIp()` function may return NULL if an error occurs while retrieving the IP address. It is recommended to check for the NULL value when using the function to avoid unwanted errors.
Ensure to free the allocated memory using `free()` after using the returned string to avoid memory leaks.

# mqtt.c Documentation
## Purpose
The purpose of the mqtt.c file is to contain functions for connecting to an MQTT broker, sending and receiving MQTT messages, and handling MQTT connection events.

## Functions
1. `void publish_message(struct mosquitto *mosq, const char *payload)`
   This function is used to publish a message to an MQTT broker. It takes a pointer to a mosquitto structure and a string as input and then publishes the message to the specified topic.

2. `void on_connect1(struct mosquitto *mosq, void *obj, int result)`
   This function serves as a callback function called when connecting to an MQTT broker. It can be used to perform additional actions after a successful connection.

3. `void on_message1(struct mosquitto *mosq, void *obj, const struct mosquitto_message *message)`
   This function serves as a callback function called when a new message is received from an MQTT broker. It receives a pointer to a mosquitto_message structure containing information about the received message and can be used to handle the message.

4. `struct mosquitto* GetMqtt()`
   This function initializes a new mosquitto structure and returns a pointer to the initialized structure. It is necessary to call this function before using other MQTT-related functions.

5. `int DestroyMQTT(struct mosquitto *mosq1)`
   This function releases resources allocated to a mosquitto structure. It is important to call this function when the MQTT object is no longer in use to avoid memory leaks.

6. `int InitMqtt(struct mosquitto *mosq1)`
   This function initializes the MQTT connection by connecting to an MQTT broker with the specified IP address and port number.

## Implementation
To use mqtt.c in your project, follow these steps:

Include the header file: Add the following line at the top of your source file to include mqtt.h:
   ```c
   #include "mqtt.h"
   ```
   Initialize MQTT: Use the `GetMqtt()` function to initialize an MQTT structure and the `InitMqtt()` function to connect to an MQTT broker.
   ```c
   struct mosquitto *mosq1 = GetMqtt();
   InitMqtt(mosq1);
   ```
   Use MQTT functions: Use the various MQTT functions such as `publish_message()` to interact with the MQTT broker.
   ```c
   publish_message(mosq1, "Hello, MQTT!");
   ```
   End MQTT connection: When finished using MQTT, release the resources by calling `DestroyMQTT()`.
   ```c
   DestroyMQTT(mosq1);
   ```

## Notes
Before using MQTT functions, ensure you have included mosquitto.h and configured your project to

 link with the Mosquitto library.
It is recommended to handle any errors that may occur during MQTT operations to ensure a robust application.
